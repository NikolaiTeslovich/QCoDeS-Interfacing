## BNC Box Configuration

A [Pomona Electronics Shielded Aluminum BNC Enclosure](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Pomona-Electronics/3752?qs=LxJU1xRJL0FUBcEnm7b%252BpQ%3D%3D) was used for the BNC enclosure. A 7.5k立 resistor was soldered as shown in the image below:

> It does not have to be exactly 7.5k立, anywhere in the range of 1k立 to 10k立 should be good

## Circuit Setup

Next, the circuit was built with the diagram below:

This is how it should look like on the bench:
